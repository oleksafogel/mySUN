        <h1>Security & Privacy Policy for mySUN - by Giraffe Apps Inc.</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: October 16, 2023</p>
        <p>At Giraffe Apps Inc., we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the responsible handling of your personal information. This Security and Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, secure, and disclose your personal information in the context of our software application, mySUN, which encourages sustainable living and reduces your Nature's Footprint.</p>
        <h2>Personal Information Defined</h2>
        <p>Personal Information refers to data about an identifiable individual, including information related to personal characteristics, health, or activities and views. It does not include business information such as business addresses or phone numbers.</p>
        <h2>Giraffe Apps Inc. and mySUN</h2>
        <p>Giraffe Apps Inc. is the owner and operator of mySUN, a software application designed to encourage sustainable living practices and reduce your Nature's Footprint. We prioritize the responsible handling of personal information and collaborate with trusted partners who share our commitment to privacy.</p>
        <h2>Why We Collect Personal Information: Primary Purposes</h2>
        <h3>User Experience</h3>
        <p>We collect, use, and disclose personal information to enhance the mySUN user experience. This may include gathering data on user preferences, game progress, and feedback to provide a personalized and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
        <h3>Third-Party Interactions</h3>
        <p>In some instances, we may collect personal information from third parties, such as user-generated content or feedback, to improve our game and foster community engagement. (For instance, if you decide to share your Nature's Footprint on social platforms, we collaborate with them to enable this feature. However, we ensure two things: First, data sharing aligns with our stringent privacy norms, and second, you always have a choice. We only share information when it's in line with our privacy principles and when we have your explicit consent.)</p>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>To create and manage user accounts, we collect and store personal information, including usernames, email addresses, and profile pictures. This information is used for authentication, communication, and customization of user profiles.</p>
        <h3>In-App Purchases and Transactions</h3>
        <p>For users making in-app purchases, we collect necessary payment information to process transactions securely and ensure a seamless purchasing experience.</p>
        <h3>Notifications and Updates</h3>
        <p>We may use personal information to send notifications, updates, and relevant information about mySUN, including news about sustainable living practices, events, and promotions. Users can opt out of these communications.</p>
        <h3>Technical Support</h3>
        <p>When users seek technical support or assistance, we collect personal information to address inquiries and provide solutions effectively.</p>
        <h3>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>We may collect, use, and disclose personal information as required by law, and regulations, or in response to legal requests, including law enforcement or government authorities.</p>
        <h2>Why We Collect Personal Information: Related and Secondary Purposes</h2>
        <p>In addition to primary purposes, we may collect, use, and disclose personal information for related and secondary purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring secure and efficient software operation.</li>
            <li>Conducting research and analysis to improve mySUN.</li>

        <p>Our goal is to help you monitor and reduce your Nature's Footprint. To achieve this, we gather geological data that aids in monitoring your daily ecological activities and facilitates check-ins to eco-conscious events. Furthermore, to continuously enhance user experience and application efficiency, we collect anonymized activity data. This data trains our neural networks to predict and track your eco-activities more seamlessly in subsequent uses. If you wish to share your Nature's Footprint achievements with loved ones, we might also request access to your social media data, but this is entirely at your discretion.</p>
